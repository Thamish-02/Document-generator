### Function: _reverse_negate(v)

### Function: _solve(tent, axisLimit, negative)

### Function: rebaseTent(tent, axisLimit)

**Description:** Given a tuple (lower,peak,upper) "tent" and new axis limits
(axisMin,axisDefault,axisMax), solves how to represent the tent
under the new axis configuration.  All values are in normalized
-1,0,+1 coordinate system. Tent values can be outside this range.

Return value is a list of tuples. Each tuple is of the form
(scalar,tent), where scalar is a multipler to multiply any
delta-sets by, and tent is a new tent for that output delta-set.
If tent value is None, that is a special deltaset that should
be always-enabled (called "gain").
