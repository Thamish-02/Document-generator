## AI Summary

A file named test_doc.py.


### Function: test_sphinx_gallery_example_header()

**Description:** We have copied EXAMPLE_HEADER and modified it to include meta keywords.
This test monitors that the version we have copied is still the same as
the EXAMPLE_HEADER in sphinx-gallery. If sphinx-gallery changes its
EXAMPLE_HEADER, this test will start to fail. In that case, please update
the monkey-patching of EXAMPLE_HEADER in conf.py.
