# 🧠 Project-Level Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the project located in `examples/sample_project`.

## 📄 test1.py
This Python code provides a basic demonstration of generating documentation and includes the following components:

1. **Functions**:
   - `hello_world()`: A function that returns the greeting "Hello, World!".
   - `add_numbers(a, b)`: A function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

2. **Class**:
   - `Calculator`: A simple class for doing basic arithmetic, which includes:
     - An initializer that sets up an empty history of calculations.
     - A method `multiply(x, y)` that multiplies two numbers, records the operation, and returns the result.
     - A method `get_history()` that returns a list of all calculations performed.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - If the script is run directly, it will print a greeting message, the result of adding 2 and 3, and show how to multiply 4 and 5 using the `Calculator` class, along with the history of calculations.

In summary, the code showcases functions and a class for performing and tracking basic arithmetic operations.
