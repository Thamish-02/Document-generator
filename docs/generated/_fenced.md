## Class: FencedDirective

**Description:** A **fenced** style of directive looks like a fenced code block, it is
inspired by markdown-it-docutils. The syntax looks like:

.. code-block:: text

    ```{directive-type} title
    :option-key: option value
    :option-key: option value

    content text here
    ```

To use ``FencedDirective``, developers can add it into plugin list in
the :class:`Markdown` instance:

.. code-block:: python

    import mistune
    from mistune.directives import FencedDirective, Admonition

    md = mistune.create_markdown(plugins=[
        # ...
        FencedDirective([Admonition()]),
    ])

FencedDirective is using >= 3 backticks or curly-brackets for the fenced
syntax. Developers can change it to other characters, e.g. colon:

.. code-block:: python

        directive = FencedDirective([Admonition()], ':')

And then the directive syntax would look like:

.. code-block:: text

    ::::{note} Nesting directives
    You can nest directives by ensuring the start and end fence matching
    the length. For instance, in this example, the admonition is started
    with 4 colons, then it should end with 4 colons.

    You can nest another admonition with other length of colons except 4.

    :::{tip} Longer outermost fence
    It would be better that you put longer markers for the outer fence,
    and shorter markers for the inner fence. In this example, we put 4
    colons outsie, and 3 colons inside.
