### Function: _nan_mask(a, out)

**Description:** Parameters
----------
a : array-like
    Input array with at least 1 dimension.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
    is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
    expected output and will prevent the allocation of a new array.

Returns
-------
y : bool ndarray or True
    A bool array where ``np.nan`` positions are marked with ``False``
    and other positions are marked with ``True``. If the type of ``a``
    is such that it can't possibly contain ``np.nan``, returns ``True``.

### Function: _replace_nan(a, val)

**Description:** If `a` is of inexact type, make a copy of `a`, replace NaNs with
the `val` value, and return the copy together with a boolean mask
marking the locations where NaNs were present. If `a` is not of
inexact type, do nothing and return `a` together with a mask of None.

Note that scalars will end up as array scalars, which is important
for using the result as the value of the out argument in some
operations.

Parameters
----------
a : array-like
    Input array.
val : float
    NaN values are set to val before doing the operation.

Returns
-------
y : ndarray
    If `a` is of inexact type, return a copy of `a` with the NaNs
    replaced by the fill value, otherwise return `a`.
mask: {bool, None}
    If `a` is of inexact type, return a boolean mask marking locations of
    NaNs, otherwise return None.

### Function: _copyto(a, val, mask)

**Description:** Replace values in `a` with NaN where `mask` is True.  This differs from
copyto in that it will deal with the case where `a` is a numpy scalar.

Parameters
----------
a : ndarray or numpy scalar
    Array or numpy scalar some of whose values are to be replaced
    by val.
val : numpy scalar
    Value used a replacement.
mask : ndarray, scalar
    Boolean array. Where True the corresponding element of `a` is
    replaced by `val`. Broadcasts.

Returns
-------
res : ndarray, scalar
    Array with elements replaced or scalar `val`.

### Function: _remove_nan_1d(arr1d, second_arr1d, overwrite_input)

**Description:** Equivalent to arr1d[~arr1d.isnan()], but in a different order

Presumably faster as it incurs fewer copies

Parameters
----------
arr1d : ndarray
    Array to remove nans from
second_arr1d : ndarray or None
    A second array which will have the same positions removed as arr1d.
overwrite_input : bool
    True if `arr1d` can be modified in place

Returns
-------
res : ndarray
    Array with nan elements removed
second_res : ndarray or None
    Second array with nan element positions of first array removed.
overwrite_input : bool
    True if `res` can be modified in place, given the constraint on the
    input

### Function: _divide_by_count(a, b, out)

**Description:** Compute a/b ignoring invalid results. If `a` is an array the division
is done in place. If `a` is a scalar, then its type is preserved in the
output. If out is None, then a is used instead so that the division
is in place. Note that this is only called with `a` an inexact type.

Parameters
----------
a : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
    Numerator. Expected to be of inexact type but not checked.
b : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
    Denominator.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
    is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
    expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.

Returns
-------
ret : {ndarray, numpy scalar}
    The return value is a/b. If `a` was an ndarray the division is done
    in place. If `a` is a numpy scalar, the division preserves its type.

### Function: _nanmin_dispatcher(a, axis, out, keepdims, initial, where)

### Function: nanmin(a, axis, out, keepdims, initial, where)

**Description:** Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
Nan is returned for that slice.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
    array, a conversion is attempted.
axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
    the minimum of the flattened array.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
    is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
    expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
    :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

    If the value is anything but the default, then
    `keepdims` will be passed through to the `min` method
    of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
    does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.
initial : scalar, optional
    The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
    computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
where : array_like of bool, optional
    Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
    for details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

Returns
-------

    An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
    removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
    scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

Notes
-----
NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
(IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

Examples
--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
>>> np.nanmin(a)
1.0
>>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
array([1.,  2.])
>>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
array([1.,  3.])

When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

>>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
1.0
>>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
-inf

### Function: _nanmean_dispatcher(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims)

### Function: nanmean(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims)

**Description:** Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis, ignoring NaNs.

Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
`float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

For all-NaN slices, NaN is returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
    array, a conversion is attempted.
axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute
    the mean of the flattened array.
dtype : data-type, optional
    Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
    is `float64`; for inexact inputs, it is the same as the input
    dtype.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
    is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
    expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
    See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

    If the value is anything but the default, then
    `keepdims` will be passed through to the `mean` or `sum` methods
    of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
    does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.
where : array_like of bool, optional
    Elements to include in the mean. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

Returns
-------
m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
    If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
    otherwise a reference to the output array is returned. Nan is
    returned for slices that contain only NaNs.

See Also
--------
average : Weighted average
mean : Arithmetic mean taken while not ignoring NaNs
var, nanvar

Notes
-----
The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
this issue.

Examples
--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
>>> np.nanmean(a)
2.6666666666666665
>>> np.nanmean(a, axis=0)
array([2.,  4.])
>>> np.nanmean(a, axis=1)
array([1.,  3.5]) # may vary

### Function: _nanmedian_dispatcher(a, axis, out, overwrite_input, keepdims)

### Function: nanmedian(a, axis, out, overwrite_input, keepdims)

**Description:** Compute the median along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

Returns the median of the array elements.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
    is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
    A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
    have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
    but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
overwrite_input : bool, optional
   If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
   calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
   `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
   the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
   but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
   False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
   `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

    If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
    through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
    `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
    a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
    will raise a RuntimeError.

Returns
-------
median : ndarray
    A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
    or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
    ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
    same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
    returned instead.

mean, median, percentile

Notes
-----
Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two
middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

Examples
--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[10.0, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
>>> a[0, 1] = np.nan
>>> a
array([[10., nan,  4.],
       [ 3.,  2.,  1.]])
>>> np.median(a)
np.float64(nan)
>>> np.nanmedian(a)
3.0
>>> np.nanmedian(a, axis=0)
array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
>>> np.median(a, axis=1)
array([nan,  2.])
>>> b = a.copy()
>>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
array([7.,  2.])
>>> assert not np.all(a==b)
>>> b = a.copy()
>>> np.nanmedian(b, axis=None, overwrite_input=True)
3.0
>>> assert not np.all(a==b)

### Function: _nanpercentile_dispatcher(a, q, axis, out, overwrite_input, method, keepdims)

### Function: nanpercentile(a, q, axis, out, overwrite_input, method, keepdims)

**Description:** Compute the qth percentile of the data along the specified axis,
while ignoring nan values.

Returns the qth percentile(s) of the array elements.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Input array or object that can be converted to an array, containing
    nan values to be ignored.
q : array_like of float
    Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be
    between 0 and 100 inclusive.
axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The default
    is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened version of the
    array.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
    the same shape and buffer length as the expected output, but the
    type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
overwrite_input : bool, optional
    If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by
    intermediate calculations, to save memory. In this case, the
    contents of the input `a` after this function completes is
    undefined.
method : str, optional
    This parameter specifies the method to use for estimating the
    percentile.  There are many different methods, some unique to NumPy.
    See the notes for explanation.  The options sorted by their R type
    as summarized in the H&F paper [1]_ are:

    1. 'inverted_cdf'
    2. 'averaged_inverted_cdf'
    3. 'closest_observation'
    4. 'interpolated_inverted_cdf'
    5. 'hazen'
    6. 'weibull'
    7. 'linear'  (default)
    8. 'median_unbiased'
    9. 'normal_unbiased'

    The first three methods are discontinuous.  NumPy further defines the
    following discontinuous variations of the default 'linear' (7.) option:

    * 'lower'
    * 'higher',
    * 'midpoint'
    * 'nearest'

    .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
        This argument was previously called "interpolation" and only
        offered the "linear" default and last four options.

keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
    the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
    result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

    If this is anything but the default value it will be passed
    through (in the special case of an empty array) to the
    `mean` function of the underlying array.  If the array is
    a sub-class and `mean` does not have the kwarg `keepdims` this
    will raise a RuntimeError.

weights : array_like, optional
    An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
    `a` contributes to the percentile according to its associated weight.
    The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
    the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
    If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
    weight equal to one.
    Only `method="inverted_cdf"` supports weights.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

interpolation : str, optional
    Deprecated name for the method keyword argument.

    .. deprecated:: 1.22.0

Returns
-------
percentile : scalar or ndarray
    If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
    is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
    the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
    the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
    contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
    data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
    same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
    returned instead.

--------
nanmean
nanmedian : equivalent to ``nanpercentile(..., 50)``
percentile, median, mean
nanquantile : equivalent to nanpercentile, except q in range [0, 1].

Notes
-----
The behavior of `numpy.nanpercentile` with percentage `q` is that of
`numpy.quantile` with argument ``q/100`` (ignoring nan values).
For more information, please see `numpy.quantile`.

--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[10., 7., 4.], [3., 2., 1.]])
>>> a[0][1] = np.nan
>>> a
array([[10.,  nan,   4.],
      [ 3.,   2.,   1.]])
>>> np.percentile(a, 50)
np.float64(nan)
>>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50)
3.0
>>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
>>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=1, keepdims=True)
array([[7.],
       [2.]])
>>> m = np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0)
>>> out = np.zeros_like(m)
>>> np.nanpercentile(a, 50, axis=0, out=out)
array([6.5, 2. , 2.5])
>>> m
array([6.5,  2. ,  2.5])

>>> b = a.copy()
>>> np.nanpercentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
array([7., 2.])
>>> assert not np.all(a==b)

### Function: _nanvar_dispatcher(a, axis, dtype, out, ddof, keepdims)

### Function: nanvar(a, axis, dtype, out, ddof, keepdims)

**Description:** Compute the variance along the specified axis, while ignoring NaNs.

Returns the variance of the array elements, a measure of the spread of
a distribution.  The variance is computed for the flattened array by
default, otherwise over the specified axis.

For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
    array, a conversion is attempted.
axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute
    the variance of the flattened array.
dtype : data-type, optional
    Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
    the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
    the array type.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
    the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
    necessary.
ddof : {int, float}, optional
    "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
    ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
    elements. By default `ddof` is zero.
keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
where : array_like of bool, optional
    Elements to include in the variance. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for
    details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

mean : array_like, optional
    Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
    a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
    The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
    the call to this var function.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

correction : {int, float}, optional
    Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
    can be provided at the same time.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

Returns
-------
variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
    If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
    otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
    number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
    NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

See Also
--------
std : Standard deviation
mean : Average
var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
nanstd, nanmean
:ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

Notes
-----
The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
variance for normally distributed variables.

Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
keyword can alleviate this issue.

For this function to work on sub-classes of ndarray, they must define
`sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

Examples
--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
>>> np.nanvar(a)
1.5555555555555554
>>> np.nanvar(a, axis=0)
array([1.,  0.])
>>> np.nanvar(a, axis=1)
array([0.,  0.25])  # may vary

### Function: _nanstd_dispatcher(a, axis, dtype, out, ddof, keepdims)

### Function: nanstd(a, axis, dtype, out, ddof, keepdims)

**Description:** Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis, while
ignoring NaNs.

Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a
distribution, of the non-NaN array elements. The standard deviation is
computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the
specified axis.

For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

Parameters
----------
a : array_like
    Calculate the standard deviation of the non-NaN values.
axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
    Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is
    to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
dtype : dtype, optional
    Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
    integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it
    is the same as the array type.
out : ndarray, optional
    Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
    the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the
    calculated values) will be cast if necessary.
ddof : {int, float}, optional
    Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
    is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
    elements.  By default `ddof` is zero.

keepdims : bool, optional
    If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
    in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
    the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

    If this value is anything but the default it is passed through
    as-is to the relevant functions of the sub-classes.  If these
    functions do not have a `keepdims` kwarg, a RuntimeError will
    be raised.
where : array_like of bool, optional
    Elements to include in the standard deviation.
    See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

    .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

mean : array_like, optional
    Provide the mean to prevent its recalculation. The mean should have
    a shape as if it was calculated with ``keepdims=True``.
    The axis for the calculation of the mean should be the same as used in
    the call to this std function.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

correction : {int, float}, optional
    Array API compatible name for the ``ddof`` parameter. Only one of them
    can be provided at the same time.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

Returns
-------
standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
    If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
    deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
    ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
    contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

See Also
--------
var, mean, std
nanvar, nanmean
:ref:`ufuncs-output-type`

Notes
-----
The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
keyword can alleviate this issue.

--------
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
>>> np.nanstd(a)
1.247219128924647
