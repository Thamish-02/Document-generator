# Sample Project

This is a sample project for the docgen documentation generator.

## Overview

This project contains examples of different file types that can be processed by docgen:

- **Python files** (`test1.py`): Contains sample functions and classes with docstrings
- **Jupyter notebooks** (`notebook1.ipynb`): Demonstrates data analysis and visualization
- **Documentation** (`README.md`): This file, providing project overview

## Files Description

### test1.py

A Python module containing:
- `hello_world()`: Simple greeting function
- `add_numbers(a, b)`: Basic arithmetic function
- `Calculator` class: Example class with methods and history tracking

### notebook1.ipynb

A Jupyter notebook demonstrating:
- Data generation with NumPy
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Visualization with Matplotlib
- Basic statistical analysis

## Usage

This sample project is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the docgen tool in processing and documenting various file types commonly found in Python projects.

### Running the Python Script

```bash
python test1.py
```

### Opening the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook1.ipynb
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (for notebook execution)

## Purpose

This sample project serves as a test case and example for:
1. Documentation generation from Python docstrings
2. Processing Jupyter notebooks for documentation
3. Combining multiple file types in a single documentation output
4. Demonstrating best practices for code documentation
